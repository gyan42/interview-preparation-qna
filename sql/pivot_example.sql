-- @Rookie_123 pivot basically groups all of your data that is not aggregated.. adding row number gives each
-- name another "grouping" to make them distinct by occupation so the MAX() aggregate does not just one name per
-- occupation, but instead gets one name per Occupation, Row_number. â€“

select [Doctor], [Professor], [Singer], [Actor] from (
    select row_number() over(partition by occupation order by name) as rn,
    name, occupation from occupations
) t
PIVOT(
    max(name)
    for occupation in ([Doctor], [Professor], [Singer], [Actor])
) as pt order by rn;
