- **Voice Separation with an Unknown Number of Multiple Speakers** ([paper & code](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/voice-separation-with-an-unknown-number-of)) - 
  Voice separation deals with separating mixed audio sequences. Nachmani et al. 
  introduce an approach based on RNNs for separating voices at multiple processing 
  steps. Particularly, the approach performs well compared to current methods when the 
  unknown number or speakers increases.
