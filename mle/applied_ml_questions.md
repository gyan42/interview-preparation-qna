 - Why does a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) work better with image data?
    - Unlike FFN, in CNN near by pixels are considerd for computation along with 
      current pixel using conv kernals
     
- Why do RNNs work better with text data?

- Which is more important to you: model accuracy or model performance?
   - Fraud detection model: High accuracy but cant detect low minirotiy frauds 
   
- How do you ensure youâ€™re not overfitting with a model? 
   - Simple models
   - Cross validation
   - Regularizers
   
- What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?
   - test/train split
   - cross validation k-fold
   - metrics
