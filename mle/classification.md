  ```
  false positive ( fraud undetected )
  false negative costs ( alarming the customer without cause )
  when a transactionâ€™s fraud probability is high, the text is sent.
  
  Interpretbility in financial models is important, I would suggest a regression model 
  whose output can be mapped to a probability distribution ( for example logistic regression accomplishes this). 
  Developers and stakeholders can then diagnose the contributions of individual features.
  
  Metric: we want to minimize the negative log likelihood on the held-out set. This leads to a minimal divergence 
  between the predicted fraud probability distribution with the true distribution.
