    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
    - The AVL trees are more balanced compared to Red-Black Trees, but they may cause more rotations during insertion 
      and deletion. So if your application involves frequent insertions and deletions, then Red-Black trees should be 
      preferred. And if the insertions and deletions are less frequent and search is a more frequent operation, then AVL 
      tree should be preferred over Red-Black Tree.
    - A four-level tree of 4 KB pages with a branching factor of 500 can store up to 256 TB.
