/*
First, I doubt that anyone wrote a State
monad like this on their first try. I’m sure it took several efforts before someone
figured out how to get what they wanted in a for expression.

Second, while this code can be hard to understand in one sitting, I’ve looked at some
of the source code inside the Scala collections classes, and there’s code in there
that’s also hard to grok. (Take a look at the sorting algorithms and you’ll see what I
mean.) Personally, the only way I can understand complex code like this is to put it
in a Scala IDE and then modify it until I make it my own.
